# Neovim Remote Plugins: NodeJS Strikes Back 

This week, I discovered amazeball things about Neovim 
remote plugins that are nothing short of paradigm-shifting, 
mind-torchblowing, game changers.

Being myself, I've been on a life-long quest to custom Vim to the point where
it'd become impossible to know where the editor stops and the man begins.
I experimented with Vim's embedded Perl interperter and created 
a [plugin system]() for it. Then I discovered [Neovim](). Highly
compatible, but with less cruft and a few extra goodies over classic Vim. 
One of those goodies was an asynchronous RPC interface for external plugins.
That's not the kind of shininess that can be resisted, so I migrated. Writing
another plugin system for Perl-based plugins along the way, because of 
course I had to.

But this week, I found out that while I had to, I might not have to anymore.

## Remote Hosts 

When I wrote `Neovim::RPC`, I only knew of the core [RPC support]()
of Neovim. Writing plugins was the (relatively) easy part. The devilish 
details were in 
the VimL code needed to start the child Perl process, the on-demand loading
of plugins the Perl 
process itself had to have  so that 
it'd not have to load the world on startup all the time,
etc.

As it turns out, Neovim has this concept of `remote hosts`, 
which provides a standard way of dealing with that heavy lifting.

### Remote Hosts Powered Plugins 

How does it work? Well, let's assume that your favorite language is 
supported (right now, off the shelf the choices are JavaScript, Python, Python3,
and Ruby). For the good 
of this example, let's assume that's `JavaScript`. In that case 
you'd drop a JavaScript script (or project directory) in
`~/.config/nvim/rplugin/node`.

Then from within neovim you'd run the command `:UpdateRemotePlugins`,
which visits all plugins and generates the list of commands, functions,
and autocommands they provides, which is then saved in
`~/.local/share/nvim/rplugin.vim`. That file will look something like:

    " node plugins
    call remote#host#RegisterPlugin('node', '/home/yanick/.config/nvim/rplugin/node/packageName.js', [
        \ {'sync': v:null, 'name': 'SetPackageName', 'type': 'command', 'opts': {}},
        \ ])
    call remote#host#RegisterPlugin('node', '/home/yanick/.config/nvim/rplugin/node/taskwarrior', [
        \ {'sync': v:null, 'name': 'TaskShow', 'type': 'function', 'opts': {}},
        \ ])


    " python3 plugins
    call remote#host#RegisterPlugin('python3', '/home/yanick/.config/nvim/plugged/deoplete.nvim/rplugin/python3/deoplete', [
        \ {'sync': v:false, 'name': '_deoplete_init', 'opts': {}, 'type': 'function'},
        \ ])


Now, the cool part is that thanks to that file, Neovim will only evaluate the
plugins' code when their associated functions/commands are invoked. 
Better still: the remote host itself will only spin to life when one of its plugins is
used. That pay-as-you-go approach means much faster startup time, and let me
have as many plugins as I want without the fear of savaging my memory budget
each time I open a new log file.

## A Perl Remote Host?

As you might have notices, Perl is missing from the list of supported remote
host languages. This is something that could be rectified with a little bit of
elbow grease. As I mentioned earlier, `Neovim::RPC` does something similar to
the other remote hosts. The trick would be to tweak it to conform to the 
standard remote host behavior (TODO link). 

And I might do just that one of these days. But right now, I thought I'd try 
the already-supported JavaScript remote host, for giggles and a few good
reasons.

First, it's already there. Although I love building my own monuments to
Hubris, sometimes a freebee does feel good.

Second, JavaScript was still using the Promise paradigm when I had my
stab at `Neovim::RPC`. Granted, the JavaScript Promises are a tad more 
natural than the Perl [Promises](), but the difference
is not overwhelming. But since came up with `async / await`, and that
mechanism does makes writing asynchronous code much more legible.

Third, the way `Neovim::RPC` works right now, it's always invoked when neovim
starts, and it weights close to 50M. The JavaScript remote host clocks less
than half of that, and as mentioned above, does not even appears until
a plugin is explicitly required.  


All that to say that, for once, I was curious to try what was already on offer
before rushing in and reimplenting it myself.
